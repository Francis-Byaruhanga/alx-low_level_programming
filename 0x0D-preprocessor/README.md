# Preprocessor in C (GCC)

In C programming, a preprocessor is a tool that performs various preprocessing tasks before the actual compilation of the code. It processes the source code before it is passed to the compiler. The main purpose of the preprocessor is to prepare the code for compilation by performing tasks such as:

1. **File Inclusion:** The preprocessor can include header files using the `#include` directive. This allows you to reuse code from other files in your program.

2. **Macro Expansion:** Macros defined using the `#define` directive are expanded by the preprocessor. Macros are used to replace certain code patterns with specific expressions, improving code readability and maintainability.

3. **Conditional Compilation:** The preprocessor can selectively include or exclude code based on preprocessor directives like `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, and `#endif`. This allows you to create platform-specific or configuration-specific code sections.

4. **Symbol Substitution:** The preprocessor can replace certain symbols with their defined values using the `#define` directive. This is commonly used for defining constants.

5. **Removing Comments:** The preprocessor can strip out comments from the code before compilation.

6. **Line Control:** The preprocessor can control the line numbering in error messages and debugging information using `#line` directives.

7. **Pragmas:** Pragmas are special instructions to the compiler provided through the preprocessor. They are used to control compiler-specific behaviors.

The preprocessor operates before the actual compilation phase and generates an intermediate code that is then passed to the compiler. Understanding the role of the preprocessor is essential for writing efficient and maintainable C code.
