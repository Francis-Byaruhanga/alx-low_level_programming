# Variadic functions

Variadic functions are a feature in programming languages that allow you to define functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. This means you can call a variadic function with any number of arguments, including none at all. In many programming languages, including C, C++, and some others, you can create variadic functions using ellipsis (`...`) in the function declaration.

Here's a brief example in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

void printNumbers(int count, ...) {
    va_list args;
    va_start(args, count);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        int num = va_arg(args, int);
        printf("%d ", num);
    }
    
    va_end(args);
}

int main() {
    printNumbers(3, 10, 20, 30);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `printNumbers` function can take a variable number of integer arguments. The `va_list`, `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` macros from the `<stdarg.h>` library are used to work with the variable arguments.

Variadic functions are useful when you want to create functions that can accommodate different numbers of input values, such as formatting functions like `printf` in C or handling dynamic argument lists in functions like in JavaScript's `console.log`.
